This project is just about having fun with Java and the Minecraft protocol.
There is no intention to become a real client.

This project is still unstable and help is always appreciated.
Fork it, patch it, do anything you want with it.

To compile and run the code, you will need Java JDK 1.7. It should work with
the JDK provided by Oracle and the "libre" JDK provided by OpenJDK.
